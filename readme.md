Steps:
1. Create a virtual environment
2. Install the requirements
3. Run the app by calling `python image_puller.py`
This will run the app and pull the images from NRDB and create a JSON dictionary. After the first time you run this you will not need to pull the images.
Overwrite mode means the program will copy over the selected card image to the `display.jpg` file. This is the file that is displayed on the screen.

To interact with the app simply type part of the name, then the number to select the option, or a letter to restart.
